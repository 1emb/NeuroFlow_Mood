If this is a production application and not an assessment, I'd first put all the keys and usernames and passwords somewhere else, maybe using enviroment variables. I'd also have a more proper planning stage and I'd name my variable differently. I'd still use the same tech, Django, Python and PostGres. For dealing with more users and and more data, I'd need a better server than my own computer, I'd also need to organise my data differntly. I'd add more services that are suitable and needed to increase app's uses. I have already add the register and logout features because it's a bit annoying to test the app without them, but when there are more users, the app definitely needs it.
